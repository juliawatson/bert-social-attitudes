This directory runs the same analysis as in ../../part_3b_bert_log_likeliood.py, 
but excluding heir/heiress and host/hostess, which patterned differently from the
other adoption-type role nouns.

This analysis allowed us to confirm that these to role nouns were driving
the unusual pattern of results for adoption-type role nouns, where
feminine forms were preferred for men's names.
